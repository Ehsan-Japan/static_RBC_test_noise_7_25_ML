"""
run_dir.py — one folder per trial, so nothing is ever overwritten.

Every main program that produces results calls new_run() first and writes
everything it makes inside the folder it gets back:

    runs/
      20260801_1432_sweep/
        config.json          exactly which settings produced this trial
        models/              one checkpoint per budget
        budget_sweep.csv
        figures/
      20260801_1550_sweep/   the next trial, untouched by the first
        ...

The folder name carries the timestamp and the kind of run, and config.json
records the settings, so a result months later can still be traced back to
what produced it.  Re-running never clobbers an earlier trial.

The measured rays are the one thing kept OUTSIDE the run folders, in a shared
grid_cache/.  They are a deterministic function of (devices, rays, points) —
identical in every trial that asks for the same budget — so re-cutting them
per run would cost minutes and change nothing.  Nothing there is ever
overwritten either (the filenames carry the budget and a hash of the device
list), and the whole directory is safe to delete: it rebuilds itself.
