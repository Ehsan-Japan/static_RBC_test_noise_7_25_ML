"""
device_factory.py — make the device folders the ML study reads.  LIBRARY ONLY.

There is no command line here on purpose; the main programs live in scripts/.
Both scripts/run_experiment.py and scripts/generate_ml_data.py call generate(),
so there is exactly one copy of "how a device is made".

One device folder is:

    <out_dir>/sample_<i>/numpy/simulation/
        charge_sensing_data.npy    the measurement
        double_dot_data.npy        the occupation map it came from
        ground_truth_labels.npy    the answer

That is all the ML study needs.  run_simulation.py runs the FULL per-device
analysis — ray plots, peak crops, four sweeps per peak, GIFs, overlays — which
is what you want when inspecting ONE device and far too slow for thousands.
The rays are cut later, offline, at whatever budget you ask for, so you never
regenerate data to change the number of rays or points.

generate() is RESUMABLE and never overwrites: a device whose
ground_truth_labels.npy already exists is skipped.  Pointing it at a folder
that is already full is therefore free, and asking for more devices than are
there only makes the missing ones.  That is what lets a pipeline request its
dataset on every run and pay for it only once.
